# FastForward 0.3.2

## Operator Registration
Fastforward quantizers are now correctly registered as operators when using
PyTorch 2.4.

## Unsigned Quantizers
Correctly set range, taking offset into account, when using symmetric
quantizers where the lowest data value >= 0. Before, the computed offset was
ignored, resulting in an incorrect quantizer.
