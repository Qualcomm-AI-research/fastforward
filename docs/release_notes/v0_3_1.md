# FastForward 0.3.1

# MPath

## Aliases
An option for aliases was added to MPath. This can reduce the duplication in a multiple
query context. In particular, an alias represents a sub-query that can be re-used by name
in another query. For example:

```python
aliases = fastforward.mpath.aliases(base="/path/to/base/module")
query = fastforward.mpath.query("&base/specific/module", aliases=aliases)
```

In this example, the resulting query represents `path/to/base/module/specific/module`


## Joint queries
The query language is extended with joint sub queries. For example, the following query
will match both `parent/child1/sub/grandchild` and `parent/child2/other/grandchild`. 

```python
my_query = mpath.query("parent/{child1/sub, child2/other}/grandchild")
```

Any valid mpath query can be used in a joint query and joint queries consist
of one or more sub-queries.

# Quantizer
The default behaviour of the affine quantizer is changed. In particular, the
offset input is rounded before quantization. This ensures that the quantized
value is always integer valued. The quantization behaviour before was:

```python
quant_value = saturate(round(data/scale - offset))
dequant_value = (quant_value + offset) * scale
```

From now on, it will be

```python
rounded_offset = round(offset)
quant_value = saturate(round(data/scale - rounded_offset))
dequant_value = (quant_value + rounded_offset) * scale
```

If required, the old behaviour can be obtained by implementing a custom
quantizer and/or quantizer function.
