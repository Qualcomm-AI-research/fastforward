# FastForward 0.2 

FastForward 0.2 is the second official release of FastForward. The library is still in
preview mode, but more features are actively being added.

## Features

### Strict Quantization

FastForward now allows for module level control of the `strict_quantization` setting, via the 
`fastforward.quantization.strict_quantization.strict_quantization_for_module` function (please
refer to the function docstring for example usage). This is in particular usefule when a 
module is not quantized and no errors related to strict quantization should be raised.

### Tile-Based Quantization

As mentioned in release [0.1](../release_notes/v0_1.md), FastForward includes the functionality
for performing tile-based quantization. This mode allows for the input tensor to be subdivided
in smaller tensors, each of which gets processed using a different quantizer (i.e. different
quantization grids). This method is now fully integrated in FastForward, and it is made the
default quantization mode. In addition, it has been incorporated in the linear quantizer class.
